# Generics with Go

Some examples of using generics in Go, including a generic version of the bubble sort function that accepts any type. This shows how useful generics are for removing code duplication. Without generics, we would have to build specific implementations of the function for each type we want to sort.

## Usage

Run in Terminal

```go
go run .
```
